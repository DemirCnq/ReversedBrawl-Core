# ReversedBrawl-Core
An open source core of Brawl Stars server

### ReversedBrawl - Project
**ReversedBrawl** is a ***lighweight*** Supercell game server written by XeonDev in **pure C++**

## Requirements
- a brain
- C++ compiler with support of POSIX API (on windows I prefer **cygwin** with **g++**)

## How to start
- Just compile & run

## How to play
This is a core of server. So you need to implement all messages and logic by yourself, glhf.
